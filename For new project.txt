Project Title: TaskMaster - Task Management Software

Description:
TaskMaster is a modern and user-friendly task management software designed to help individuals and teams stay organized and productive. It incorporates features to streamline task creation, tracking, prioritization, and collaboration. This software is suitable for both personal and professional use.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement a secure user authentication system to allow users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.

Task Creation and Editing: Users can easily create, edit, and categorize tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level.

Task Prioritization: Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and sort tasks based on priority.

Task Assignment: Enable users to assign tasks to themselves or other team members. Users should receive notifications when a task is assigned to them.

Task Progress Tracking: Users can update the status of tasks (e.g., in progress, completed) and track their progress over time.

Task Filters and Sorting: Implement filters and sorting options to help users easily find and organize their tasks based on criteria like due date, priority, status, or category.

Collaboration: Support collaboration by allowing users to share tasks and collaborate on them with team members. Real-time updates and notifications should be provided.

Dashboard: Create a user-friendly dashboard that provides an overview of tasks, upcoming deadlines, and task statistics.

Search Functionality: Implement a robust search feature to help users quickly find specific tasks or projects.

Responsive Design: Ensure the software is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Data Security: Prioritize data security and user privacy by implementing encryption and secure data storage practices.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js or Python (using frameworks like Express.js or Django)
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
User Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth
Real-time Updates: WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io)
Deployment: AWS, Heroku, or similar cloud platforms
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Additional Ideas for Enhancement:

Integration with popular productivity tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack).
Task analytics and reporting.
Mobile app version.
Dark mode for the UI.
Task reminders and notifications via email or push notifications.
